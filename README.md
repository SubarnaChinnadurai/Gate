# Gate Capacitance Modeling


### INTRODUCTION:
*We propose a model for the gate capacitance of GaN-based trench-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors, based on combined measurements, analytical calculations and TCAD simulations.


*The trench capacitance is found to be equivalent to four different capacitors, used to model the various regions with different doping and orientation of the semiconductor/dielectric interface.


*In addition, we demonstrate and explain the characteristic double-hump behavior of the G-D and G-DS capacitance of trench-MOSFETs. Lastly, a TCAD simulation results accurately reproduce the experimental data, thus confirming the interpretation on the double hump behavior, and providing insight on the electron density at the gate interface.
